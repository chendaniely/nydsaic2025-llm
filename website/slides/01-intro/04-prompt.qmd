[Getting started with AI: Good enough prompting](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/getting-started-with-ai-good-enough)

> Treat AI like an infinitely patient **new coworker** who forgets everything you tell them each new conversation, one that comes **highly recommended** but whose actual abilities are not that clear. Two parts of this are analogous to working with humans (being new on the job and being a coworker) and two of them are very alien (forgetting everything and being infinitely patient). We should **start with where AIs are closest to humans, because that is the key to good-enough prompting.**

## A conversation

```{.bash code-line-numbers="7-10"}
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a terse assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of the moon?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "The moon does not have a capital. It is not inhabited or governed."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Are you sure?"}
    ]
}'
```
- Model: model used
- System prompt: behind-the-scenes instructions and information for the model
- User prompt: a question or statement for the model to respond to

## System Prompt

Python

```python
from chatlas import ChatOpenAI

chat = ChatOpenAI()
chat.system_prompt = "I want you to act like Yoda."
chat.chat("I need your help.")
```

R

```r
library(ellmer)

chat <- chat_anthropic()
chat$set_system_prompt("I want you to act like Yoda")
chat$chat("I need your help.")
```

## Prompt templates

Python

`prompt.md`
```
I want you to act like {{ role }}
```

Python

```python
from chatlas import ChatOpenAI, interpolate_file

chat = ChatOpenAI()
chat.system_prompt = interpolate_file(
  "prompt.md",
  variables={"role": "Yoda"}
)
chat.system_prompt
```

R

```R
library(ellmer)

chat <- chat_anthropic()
chat$set_system_prompt(
  interpolate_file("prompt.md", role = "Yoda")
)
chat$get_system_prompt()
```

## Writing a good prompt: RODES

- **R**ole: Set the scene
- **O**bjective: Define a purpose
- **D**etail: Influence behaviour, provide missing information, follow up information
- **E**xample: Use specific examples, outline tasks,
- **S**tyle:

## Example: Instagram cooking reel (Role)

You are a useful and understanding chef trying to help me create a recipe book.

## Example: Instagram cooking reel (Objective)

I will be giving you cooking instructions and I need you you format the content
into a recipe card.
The recipe card will provide a
shopping list,
list of ingredients,
and then a set of instructions
on how to cook the ingredients.

## Example: Instagram cooking reel (Detail)

Please provide all units and measurements in both metric and imperial measurements.
If you are unsure about a measurement or instruction,
I would rather you tell me to look into the original source,
than try to make it up.

Sort the shopping list by grocery store aisle.
Provide the output in the following order: shopping list, ingredient list, cooking instructions.

The text may be in different languages.
Translate any non English text into English and return all the results in English.

Below are the video and text instructions.

## Example: Instagram cooking reel (Example)

None.

## Example: Instagram cooking reel (Style)

Keep the output text around 80 characters per line.
