## Find structure in data

From the [chatlas docs](https://posit-dev.github.io/chatlas/get-started/structured-data.html):

1. Article summaries: Extract key points from lengthy reports or articles to create concise summaries for decision-makers.
2. Entity recognition: Identify and extract entities such as names, dates, and locations from unstructured text to create structured datasets.
3. Sentiment analysis: Extract sentiment scores and associated entities from customer reviews or social media posts to gain insights into public opinion.
4. Classification: Classify text into predefined categories, such as spam detection or topic classification.
5. Image/PDF input: Extract data from images or PDFs, such as tables or forms, to automate data entry processes.

## Components

- `chatlas`: `Chat.extract_data()` method
- `pydantic`: data model from `BaseModel`, with optional `Field` descriptions

## Simple example:

```python
import chatlas as ctl
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Person(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

chat = ctl.ChatOpenAI()
chat.extract_data(
  "My name is Susan and I'm 13 years old",
  data_model=Person,
)
```

output:

```
{"name": "Susan", "age": 13}
```
