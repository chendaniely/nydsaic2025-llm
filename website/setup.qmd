title: Setup
---

## R + Python

1. Clone this repository: <https://github.com/chendaniely/nydsaic2025-llm>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chendaniely/nydsaic2025-llm.git
git clone git@github.com:chendaniely/nydsaic2025-llm.git
```

2. Use the provided `requirements.txt` and `renv.lock` file to create the virtual environments
    - R: you can use the `setup-r` `Makefile` target
    - Python: if you have `uv` installed (<https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>) you can also use the `setup-python` target
    - There is a convenience `make setup` target that combines both for you

```bash
make setup
```

## IDE

I'm using Positron: <https://positron.posit.co/>, but feel free to use VS Code and/or RStudio

## GitHub Models

You will need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).
It does not need any context (e.g., repo, workflow, etc).

General instructions from the GitHub docs on creating a PAT: <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic>
